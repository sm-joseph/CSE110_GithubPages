# Hi! I'm Sanjit!
## Welcome to my **CSE 110** _Lab 1_ Markdown Assignment

## About Me!
I think the best advice I've ever heard comes from the Scout Motto:
> "Be Prepared"

It seems simple, but being able to anticipate things in all areas of life and trying to prepare for them has really saved me from a lot of headaches. 

## My Favorites!

My two favorite colors are (in no particular order):
- British Racing Green `#004225`
- Cerulean Blue `#2A52BE`

My favorite piece of code has got to be the `switch` statement. It has come in useful in a lot of niche situations, and although most things are doable without it, it's a really elegant way to simplify code.

My top 3 favorite songs are probably:
1. [November Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SbUC-UaAxE)
2. [Live and Let Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR0UmZcf89E)
3. [Jessica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTOozRAJ8dU)
